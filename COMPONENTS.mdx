# Available React Components

This document provides an overview of the React components available for use in Theorym content. For a live demonstration of these components, visit [ui.theorym.org](https://ui.theorym.org).

## How to Import Components

At the top of your MDX file, import the components you need:

```jsx
import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/callout'
import { Steps } from '@/components/ui/steps'
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from '@/components/ui/tabs'
```

## Basic Components

### Callout

```jsx
<Callout type="info">
  This is an informational callout.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  This is a warning callout.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  This is an error callout.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  This is a tip callout.
</Callout>
```

### Tabs

```jsx
<Tabs defaultValue="tab1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="tab1">Tab 1</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="tab2">Tab 2</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="tab1">
    Content for tab 1
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="tab2">
    Content for tab 2
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

### Steps

```jsx
<Steps>
  <Step>First step in a process</Step>
  <Step>Second step in a process</Step>
  <Step>Final step in a process</Step>
</Steps>
```

## Mathematical Components

### Theorem

```jsx
<Theorem name="Pythagorean Theorem">
  In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
  
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
</Theorem>
```

### Proof

```jsx
<Proof>
  Let's prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
  
  Assume, for contradiction, that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers with no common factors.
  
  Therefore, $2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$, which means $p^2 = 2q^2$.
  
  This means $p^2$ is even, which means $p$ is even.
  
  So $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
  
  Substituting, we get $4k^2 = 2q^2$, which means $q^2 = 2k^2$.
  
  This means $q^2$ is even, which means $q$ is even.
  
  But this contradicts our assumption that $p$ and $q$ have no common factors.
  
  Therefore, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
</Proof>
```

### Definition

```jsx
<Definition term="Vector">
  A quantity having direction as well as magnitude, especially as determining the position of one point in space relative to another.
</Definition>
```

## Interactive Components

### Quiz

```jsx
<Quiz>
  <Question>
    <QuestionText>
      What is the derivative of $f(x) = x^2$?
    </QuestionText>
    <QuestionOptions>
      <Option correct>$f'(x) = 2x$</Option>
      <Option>$f'(x) = x^2$</Option>
      <Option>$f'(x) = 2$</Option>
      <Option>$f'(x) = x$</Option>
    </QuestionOptions>
    <Explanation>
      The derivative of $x^n$ is $nx^{n-1}$. So for $x^2$, the derivative is $2x^{2-1} = 2x$.
    </Explanation>
  </Question>
</Quiz>
```

### Interactive Graph

```jsx
<InteractiveGraph
  function="x^2"
  xRange={[-10, 10]}
  yRange={[-10, 100]}
  gridLines={true}
/>
```

### Code Block

```jsx
<CodeBlock
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={true}
  highlightLines={[3, 4, 5]}
>
{`def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120`}
</CodeBlock>
```

## Layout Components

### Card

```jsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    This is the main content of the card.
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <Button>Learn More</Button>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

### Grid

```jsx
<Grid columns={3}>
  <GridItem>First item</GridItem>
  <GridItem>Second item</GridItem>
  <GridItem>Third item</GridItem>
</Grid>
```

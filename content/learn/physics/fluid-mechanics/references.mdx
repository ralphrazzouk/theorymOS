# References

This comprehensive bibliography covers the historical development of fluid mechanics from ancient times to modern computational methods. The references are organized chronologically and by theme, covering key figures, theoretical developments, and technological applications that have shaped our understanding of fluid behavior.

## How to Use This Bibliography

The references in the frontmatter above are structured according to our new reference system and will appear in an interactive modal when viewing this page. The references are categorized by:

- **Historical Overview**: General sources covering the broad development of fluid mechanics
- **Ancient Foundations**: Archimedes and early hydrostatics
- **Renaissance Period**: Leonardo da Vinci's observational studies
- **17th Century**: Torricelli, Pascal, and pressure principles
- **18th Century**: Bernoulli's principle and Euler's equations
- **19th Century**: Navier-Stokes equations and Reynolds' work
- **20th Century**: Prandtl's boundary layer theory
- **Modern Developments**: Computational fluid dynamics and microfluidics

## About This Collection

These sources support the historical narrative presented in our fluid mechanics history content, tracing the evolution from empirical hydraulic engineering to sophisticated mathematical modeling and computational simulation. Each reference includes proper bibliographic information, direct links where available, and descriptive tags for easy categorization.

The references demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of fluid mechanics, drawing from physics, mathematics, engineering, and computational sciences to build our current understanding of fluid behavior.

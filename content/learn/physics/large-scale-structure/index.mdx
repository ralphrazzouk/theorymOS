- Galaxy Formation
- Structure Formation
- Gravitational Clustering
- Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
- Correlation Functions
- Power Spectrum Analysis
- Redshift Surveys
- Galaxy Bias
- Nonlinear Evolution
- N-body Simulations
- Halo Models
- Cosmic Filaments
- Matter Distribution
- Large-Scale Flows
- Environmental Effects

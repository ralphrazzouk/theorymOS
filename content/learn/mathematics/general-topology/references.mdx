TIL that in 1736 the mathematician Leonhard Euler was trying to find a way to cross every single one of the seven bridges of Königsberg exactly once. He realized that this was, in fact, impossible and based on that created a new area of mathematics called Graph Theory. : r/todayilearned - Reddit, accessed August 31, 2025, https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/a0tl5a/til_that_in_1736_the_mathematician_leonhard_euler/

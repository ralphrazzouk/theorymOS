# General Topology: Course Outline

This outline provides a comprehensive introduction to general topology, the study of spatial properties preserved under continuous deformations. The course progresses from basic set-theoretic concepts to advanced topological structures and their applications.

## Course Description

General topology, also known as point-set topology, is the branch of mathematics that studies topological spaces and the continuous maps between them. This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of topology, including open and closed sets, continuity, compactness, and connectedness. Students will develop an understanding of how topological concepts generalize and unify many ideas from analysis and geometry.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of topological spaces and their properties
- Work with various topologies on a given set and understand their relationships
- Analyze continuity, homeomorphisms, and topological equivalence
- Apply concepts of compactness, connectedness, and separability
- Understand metric spaces as special cases of topological spaces
- Recognize topological concepts in other areas of mathematics

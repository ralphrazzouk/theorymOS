# Formal Logic: Course Outline

This outline provides a comprehensive introduction to formal mathematical logic, guiding students from the foundational principles of symbolic reasoning to the profound metatheoretical results that define the scope and limits of formal systems.

## Course Description

This course is a rigorous introduction to the principles of deductive reasoning using symbolic techniques. We will begin with propositional logic, developing skills in translating natural language arguments into a formal language and evaluating their validity using truth tables and natural deduction. We will then advance to the more expressive system of first-order predicate logic, which allows for the formalization of arguments involving objects, properties, and quantifiers. The course will culminate in a study of the properties of these logical systems themselves, exploring the foundational concepts of soundness, completeness, and the philosophical implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorems.

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites beyond a readiness for abstract, mathematical-style reasoning. The course is suitable for students in philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.

## Core Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Identify the logical structure of arguments in natural language.
- Translate sentences and arguments into the formal languages of propositional and first-order logic.
- Use truth tables to determine logical properties and relations (e.g., tautology, contradiction, equivalence, validity).
- Construct formal proofs using a system of natural deduction.
- Understand the semantics of first-order logic through the use of models and interpretations.
- Comprehend the major metatheoretical results, including soundness and completeness, and articulate their significance.

## Part I: Propositional Logic (PL) - The Logic of Sentences

### 1. Foundations of Logic

**Topics:** What is logic? Arguments, premises, and conclusions. The concepts of validity and soundness. Introduction to formal languages.

### 2. The Language of Propositional Logic (PL)

**Topics:** Atomic sentences and logical connectives (negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional). Well-formed formulas (WFFs). Translation from English into PL.

**Skills:** Symbolization of complex English sentences.

### 3. Semantics of PL

**Topics:** Truth tables for connectives. Using truth tables to classify sentences (tautology, contradiction, contingency). Testing for logical equivalence and validity.

**Skills:** Construction of full and partial truth tables.

### 4. Natural Deduction in PL (Part 1)

**Topics:** The concept of a formal proof. Introduction to natural deduction. Rules for conjunction ($\land I$, $\land E$), conditional ($\to I$, $\to E$), and negation ($\lnot I$, $\lnot E$), including proof by contradiction.

**Skills:** Constructing simple formal proofs.

### 5. Natural Deduction in PL (Part 2)

**Topics:** Rules for disjunction ($\lor I$, $\lor E$) and the biconditional ($\leftrightarrow I$, $\leftrightarrow E$). Derived rules. Proving theorems.

**Skills:** Constructing more complex proofs involving all connectives.

## Part II: First-Order Logic (FOL) - The Logic of Objects and Properties

### 6. The Language of First-Order Logic (FOL)

**Topics:** Limitations of PL. Introduction to predicates, names, and variables. The quantifiers: universal ($\forall$) and existential ($\exists$).

**Skills:** Translating sentences with quantifiers from English to FOL.

### 7. Semantics of FOL

**Topics:** The concept of a model (or interpretation). Domains, interpretation functions, and variable assignments. The idea of satisfaction. Proving invalidity in FOL by finding a counter-model.

**Skills:** Constructing small models to test the truth of FOL sentences.

### 8. Natural Deduction in FOL (Part 1)

**Topics:** Universal quantifier rules ($\forall E$, $\forall I$). Existential quantifier rules ($\exists I$, $\exists E$).

**Skills:** Building proofs involving quantifiers. Understanding the restrictions on quantifier introduction rules.

### 9. Natural Deduction in FOL (Part 2)

**Topics:** Quantifier negation equivalences (e.g., $\lnot\forall x P(x) \Leftrightarrow \exists x \lnot P(x)$). Strategy for proofs in FOL.

**Skills:** Combining quantifier rules with propositional rules in complex proofs.

### 10. Identity

**Topics:** The identity predicate ($=$). Rules for identity (reflexivity, $=E$). Translation of definite descriptions ("the king of France") and numerical statements ("at least two", "exactly one").

**Skills:** Constructing proofs with the identity relation.

## Part III: Metatheory and Beyond

### 11. Introduction to Metatheory & Set Theory

**Topics:** The distinction between syntax and semantics. Basic concepts of naive set theory (sets, subsets, union, intersection, power sets, relations, functions) needed for metatheory.

**Skills:** Understanding the formal tools used to prove results about logic systems.

### 12. Soundness

**Topics:** The concept of soundness: "If you can prove it, it must be true." Sketch of the soundness proof for PL and FOL (proof by induction).

**Skills:** Articulating the importance of a sound deductive system.

### 13. Completeness

**Topics:** The concept of completeness: "If it's true, you can prove it." Sketch of the completeness proof for PL and FOL (Henkin-style proof).

**Skills:** Understanding the deep relationship between syntactic provability and semantic truth.

### 14. Limits of Logic

**Topics:** Computability and the Halting Problem. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems: discussion of their statements and profound philosophical implications for mathematics and logic.

**Skills:** Appreciating the established boundaries of formal systems.

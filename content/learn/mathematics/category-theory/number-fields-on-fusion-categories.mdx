# Introduction

The defining field $k$ is the base field over which the $\text{Hom}$-sets of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ are vector spaces, and the tensor product is $k$-linear.

<Definition>
    A field extension $K \subseteq E$ is called a **splitting field** for $\mathcal{C}$ if for every simple object $X \in \mathcal{C}$,
    the endomorphism algebra $\text{End}_{\mathcal{C}_K}(X_K) \cong K$, where $\mathcal{C}_K = \mathcal{C} \otimes_{E} K$ is the base change of $\mathcal{C}$ to $K$.
    In other words, all the simple objects of $\mathcal{C}_K$ become "split-simple" over $K$.
</Definition>

One often seeks the smallest such field extension $K$.

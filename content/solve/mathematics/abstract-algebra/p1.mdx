# Problem 1

Prove that the set of all integers is not a group under addition.

## Proof

The set of all integers is not a group under addition because it does not satisfy the group axioms.
- Closure: The sum of two integers is an integer.
- Associativity: The sum of three integers is independent of the order of the integers.
- Identity: The sum of an integer and 0 is the integer.
- Inverse: The inverse of an integer is the integer that, when added to the original integer, gives 0.
- Commutativity: The sum of two integers is independent of the order of the integers.
- Distributivity: The sum of two integers is independent of the order of the integers.
- Associativity: The sum of three integers is independent of the order of the integers.

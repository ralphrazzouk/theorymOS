# Automata Theory

Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and computational models. It provides a theoretical foundation for understanding computation and formal languages.

## Topics

- Deterministic Finite Automata
- Non-Deterministic Finite Automata
- Regular Languages
- Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages
- Context Free Grammars
- Pushdown Automata
- Turing Machines
- Church-Turing Thesis
- Turing-Completeness
- Incompleteness and Undecidability
